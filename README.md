# Bordeaux FIR (LFBB) Configuration for TopSky & CoFrance  

Welcome to the **Bordeaux FIR (LFBB)** GitHub repository! This setup is compatible with both **TopSky** and the **CoFrance plugin**.  

âš  **Disclaimer:** This package is **NOT** officially supported by the French vACC. No support will be provided.  

## Features  

This configuration includes:  

- **Airspace Management:** All **LF-D, LF-R, RTBA/AZBA, LF-TRA**, and soon **LF-P** zones are defined and can be activated automatically based on NOTAMs or manually.  
- **Data Link Communications:** Fully functional **CPDLC & DCL**.  
- **Custom Maps:** Tailored maps for **runways, extended centerlines, CTR, CTA, TMA, SIV, MRVA, ACC**, and **SID/STAR/Procedures (coming soon)**, dynamically adjusting based on selected runways and zoom levels.  
- **MRVA & MSAW Definitions:** Accurately implemented within the **TopSky environment**.
